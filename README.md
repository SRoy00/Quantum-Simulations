# Quantum-Simulations

Simulation of many-body physics and quantum algorithms on multi-qubit IBM devices.

## File Descriptions

* **krylov diagonalization.ipynb**
    Contains Krylov diagonalization methods implemented in Qiskit and their extension to the Anderson model.

* **GPU_accelerated_MPS_MBL_SQD.ipynb**
    Contains examples of Matrix Product States (MPS), Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE), and Subspace Quantum Dynamics (SQD) in a GPU-accelerated setup.
    *(Note: Optimized for NVidia T4 GPUs on Google Colab)*

* Ising_model.ipynb: To be uploaded, uses IBM quantum machines for ising model related tests.
